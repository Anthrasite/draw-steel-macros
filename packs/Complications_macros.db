Provided you meet the ability’s other prerequisites and can spend any required Heroic Resource, you can use the ability. Once you use this benefit, you can’t do so again until you earn 2 or more Victories.</p>\n    <p><b>Drawback:</b> While you are winded, you take a −2 penalty to speed.</p>`,\n  source: \"Complication\"\n});" }
