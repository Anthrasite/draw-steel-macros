<p><strong>Effect:</strong> While worn, a red Color Cloak grants you fire immunity equal to your level.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you are targeted by any effect that deals fire damage, you can use a triggered action to reduce the damage to 0. If you do so, the fire immunity granted by this cloak becomes fire weakness with the same value until the end of the next round. You canâ€™t use this triggered action again until this weakness ends.</p>
