<p><strong>Effect:</strong> As a maneuver, you toss the coin in the air and let it fall to the ground in front of you. Roll a d3 to determine the coin’s effect, depending on which face shows when it lands:</p>
<p><strong>1—Red:</strong> The area within 2 squares of you is difficult terrain for enemies until the end of your next turn.</p>
<p><strong>2—Green:</strong> You and each ally who starts their turn within 2 squares of you gains a +1 bonus to speed until the end of your next turn.</p>
<p><strong>3—Spinning Coin:</strong> Both the red and green effects occur while the coin continuously spins.</p>
<p>The coin must be picked up before it can be used again. If any creature picks up the coin, its effects immediately end.</p>
