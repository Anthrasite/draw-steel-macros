<p><strong>Effect:</strong> When you use a move action while wearing these gloves, you can place one hand upon a mundane object as part of that move action. If the object is 1 square thick or less and has open space on the other side (for example, a door or wall), you pull your body through it as though the object wasn’t there.</p>
<p>If the object is too thick or has no open space on the other side, your hand becomes stuck inside the object. Removing your hand takes a successful hard Might test made as a main action.</p>
