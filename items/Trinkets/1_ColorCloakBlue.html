<p><strong>Effect:</strong> While worn, a blue Color Cloak grants you cold immunity equal to your level.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you are targeted by any effect that deals cold damage, you can use a triggered action to shift a number of squares equal to your level. If you do so, the cold immunity granted by the cloak becomes cold weakness with the same value until the end of the next round. You canâ€™t use this triggered action again until this weakness ends.</p>
