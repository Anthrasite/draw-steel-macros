  <strong>Item Prerequisites:</strong> Fifty snapdragon seeds<br>
  <strong>Project Source:</strong> Texts or lore in Yllyric<br>
  <strong>Project Roll Characteristic:</strong> Reason or Intuition<br>

</p>
<p><strong>Effect:</strong> As a maneuver, you sniff a magic snapdragon blossom, causing it to whither and making your movements more forceful and explosive. The next damage-dealing ability you use deals an extra 5 damage and gains a +2 bonus to the distance of any forced movement it imposes. If the ability does not impose forced movement, you can push each creature targeted by the ability up to 2 squares.</p>
