<p><em>A cloudy glass vial holds a writhing monstrous grub.</em></p>
<p>
  <strong>Keywords:</strong> Psionic<br>
  <strong>Item Prerequisites:</strong> A grub steeped in voiceless talker bile<br>
  <strong>Project Source:</strong> Texts or lore in Variac<br>
  <strong>Project Roll Characteristic:</strong> Might or Intuition<br>
  <strong>Project Goal:</strong> 180
</p>
<p><strong>Effect:</strong> When you release the larva as a maneuver, it feeds on psychic energy to grow exponentially, creating a 10 wall of larval flesh adjacent to you. The wall can’t be created to fill any square occupied by a creature with stability 1 or higher. Each other creature in the wall when it is created is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space.</p>
<p>At the start of each of your turns, each creature adjacent to the wall takes psychic damage equal to three times their Intuition score, and you can add 1 square to the wall for each creature who takes this damage. If no creature takes damage at the start of your turn, the larva dies and the wall disappears.</p>
