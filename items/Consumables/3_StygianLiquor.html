<p><strong>Effect:</strong> When you drink this potion as a maneuver, you gain a tenacious will to cling to life for 24 hours. If you are dying during this time, you don’t die until you reach the negative of your Stamina maximum rather than your winded value. Additionally, while you are dying, you gain an edge on power rolls and you take half the damage dealt by the bleeding condition. Once the potion’s magic is triggered, it ends when you are no longer dying.</p>
