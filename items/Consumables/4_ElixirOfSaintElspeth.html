<p><strong>Effect:</strong> When you pour the elixir onto your forehead as a maneuver, it vanishes and you protect yourself against effects that might harm your body, mind, or soul. For a number of rounds equal to your current Victories, any enemy ability targeting you automatically obtains a tier 1 outcome against you. Additionally, the ability can only deal damage to you, letting you ignore its other effects.</p>
