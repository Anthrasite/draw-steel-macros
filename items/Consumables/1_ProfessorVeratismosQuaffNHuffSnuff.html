<p><strong>Effect:</strong> As a maneuver, you sprinkle a dose of this powder onto food or drink, or blow it at an adjacent creature who is grabbed, restrained, or unconscious. A creature who is exposed to blown powder (even if they hold their breath) or consumes a dose of the powder must communicate in only true statements for 1 hour. Additionally, other creatures gain an edge on Intuition and Presence tests made to convince the target to communicate, or to read the target’s emotions. Any such creature has a double edge on the test if the target doesn’t realize they’ve been affected by the snuff.</p>
