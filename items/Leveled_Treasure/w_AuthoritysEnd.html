<p><strong>1st Level:</strong> Any weapon ability that deals rolled damage using this weapon gains a +1 damage bonus. Whenever you damage a creature with the weapon, you can immediately use a maneuver to end one effect imposed by that creature on you or another creature within 5 squares of you.</p>
<p><strong>5th Level:</strong> The weapon’s damage bonus increases to +2. Additionally, you and each ally within 2 squares of you gains a +1 bonus to saving throws.</p>
<p><strong>9th Level:</strong> The weapon’s damage bonus increases to +3. Additionally, you no longer need to use a maneuver to end one effect when you damage a creature with the weapon. The weapon also refuses to vie for control of your psyche, and no longer counts against the limit of leveled treasures you can carry safely.</p>
