This makes projects seeking common lore free, but such projects still require a respite activity to complete.</p>
    <p>Additionally, if you have 24 hours or more before a combat encounter or negotiation, and you have one or more clues or rumors regarding the encounter or negotiation, you can make a Reason test as a respite activity. You can make this test only once for any encounter or negotiation.</p>`,
