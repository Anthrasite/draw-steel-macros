    <p>Once as a free maneuver on each of your turns, you can spend 1 discipline and give your Null Field one of the following additional effects until the start of your next turn:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gravitic Disruption</strong>: The first time on a turn that a target takes damage, you can slide them up to 2 squares.</li>
      <li><strong>Inertial Anchor</strong>: Any target who starts their turn in the area canâ€™t shift.</li>
      <li><strong>Synaptic Break</strong>: Whenever you or any ally uses an ability against a target that has a potency effect, the potency is increased by 1.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This ability remains active even after an encounter ends. It ends only if you are dying or if you willingly end it (no action required).</p>`
