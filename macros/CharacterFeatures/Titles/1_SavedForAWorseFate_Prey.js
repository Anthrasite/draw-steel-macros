  description: `<p>After being defeated, each character awakes, alive and with full Stamina and Recoveries. You are all captives of the creatures who defeated you, and a gruesome end awaits you—unless you can escape or overcome the nefarious challenge your captors have planned.</p>
    <p>Your captors plan to release you and hunt you down, but it’s no fun unless you offer a challenge. Each of you is given a medicinal draught that grants a +1 bonus to speed and increases your Recoveries by 2. This benefit lasts until the end of your next respite.</p>`,
