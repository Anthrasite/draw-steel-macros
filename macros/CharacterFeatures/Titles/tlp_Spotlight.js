This light lasts for 1 minute, until the creature is more than 10 squares away from you, or until you dismiss the effect (no action required). While illuminated, a creature canâ€™t sneak or hide, they take a bane on tests made to perform any action secretly, and they gain an edge on tests made using the Lead, Music, or Perform skills.`,
