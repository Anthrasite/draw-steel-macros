  description: `<p>You have long stayed one step ahead of a pursuer—perhaps a bounty hunter determined to bring you to justice, a revenant, or an assassin intent on your death. Someday, you’ll be strong enough to face your pursuer. But for now, you live your life on the run.</p>
    <p><b>Benefit:</b> You have one skill of your choice from the intrigue skill group. Additionally, whenever one or more creatures are pursuing you, you can lay low as a respite activity. When you do so, anyone pursuing you loses track of your and your party’s location and must start their search again.</p>
    <p><b>Drawback:</b> Each time you earn Renown, your pursuer learns your location. Unless you lay low or move to a new location, you’ll be visited by agents of the pursuer within 1d10 days. If you linger after that, your pursuer finds you.</p>`,
